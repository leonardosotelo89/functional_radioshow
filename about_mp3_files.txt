mp3 name:
mp3 file name must be lowercase and without spaces 

be careful: 
if you need to rename the song 
is better to do it locally and then 
after delete the old one 
upload the new re-named file

to add a new song:
once all needed audios are uploaded then
you can change your index so when the code
call the audios they will be there 

each directory should be below 1000 files length 

to change an mp3 for one with different playbackrate or 
volume boosted just name it as the old one and upload the file 
with the same filename as the old one in the same directory 
the old one must be replaced by the altered
