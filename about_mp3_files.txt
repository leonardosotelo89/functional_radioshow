mp3 name:
mp3 file name must be lowercase and without spaces 

be careful: 
if you need to rename the song 
is better to do it locally and then 
after delete the old one 
upload the new re-named file

to add a new song:
once all needed audios are uploaded then
you can change your index so when the code
call the audios they will be there
